      <description>Hello there, this is my first blog post. I don&amp;rsquo;t have much to say about this, but I invite you to stay tuned because in the coming days will come out many articles.
 Also, there will be two categories of post here:
 Researches about theory (R) Applications / Practice (A)  So, keep in mind which one of the two letters the post contains, because it is to specify at a glance its type.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Hello there, this is my first blog post. I don&amp;rsquo;t have much to say about this, but I invite you to &lt;strong&gt;stay tuned&lt;/strong&gt; because in the coming days will come out many articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, there will be two categories of post here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researches about theory (&lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applications / Practice (&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, keep in mind which one of the two letters the post contains, because it is to specify at a glance its type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1_R&lt;/strong&gt; its a possible title of a post about Research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1_A&lt;/strong&gt; its a possible title of a post about Applications / Practice&lt;/li&gt;
