&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If a 30 year old man has his head in an oven and his feet in ice, a statistician would say that on average he feels fine.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are tons of data out there and all those numbers alone don&amp;rsquo;t make much sense, this is where the statistics comes in, in statistics we carry out &lt;strong&gt;analysis, interpretation, organization and presentation of this data&lt;/strong&gt;, so informed decision can be made. A trivial example that we can observe every day are the weather forecasts, to make this forecasts statisticians create computer models based on previous weather reports. But statistics is literally &lt;strong&gt;everywhere&lt;/strong&gt;, here&amp;rsquo;s an example of some of the sectors that use it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pharmaceutical Industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Food Industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Designer Brands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insurance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Medicine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, in this historical moment we all know unfortunately that there&amp;rsquo;s a pandemic of &lt;strong&gt;Covid-19&lt;/strong&gt; in progress, even here the statistics play a &lt;strong&gt;key role&lt;/strong&gt;, as you can make estimates of how many contagions there may be in the future, given the current contagions. Take &lt;strong&gt;Covid vaccines&lt;/strong&gt; also as an example, did you know that pharmaceutical companies like &lt;strong&gt;Pfizer&lt;/strong&gt; employ many statisticians? Here they analyze the results conducted in preclinical research and clinical trials,
to help then develop a vaccine that is &lt;strong&gt;safe and effective&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;is-statistics-a-science-a-branch-of-mathematics-or-both-&#34;&gt;Is statistics a science, a branch of mathematics or both? ü§î&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can summarize the above with a quote from American Statistical Association:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Statistics is the science of learning from data, and of measuring, controlling and communicating &lt;strong&gt;uncertainty&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;also, John Turkey (author of Exploratory Dat Analysis) said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúStatistics is a science, not a branch of mathematics, but it uses mathematical models as essential tools.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What‚Äôs the difference?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary difference between the two is &lt;strong&gt;uncertainty&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider two problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How far is it to work in miles?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How far is it to work in minutes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first problem is a math problem because, assuming you take the same route, the answer is fixed. The second problem is a statistical problem because you will not always get the same answer due to weather or traffic conditions, how many lights you get stuck at etc., there is a level of uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in order to understand statistics you do need to know probability which is a branch of mathematics (The study of finite measures that a normalized to 1). But probability is not statistics anymore than algebra is physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&#34;also-what-defines-a-scientific-field&#34;&gt;Also, what defines a scientific field?&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every field of scientific inquiry is defined by &lt;strong&gt;three things&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What it studies: Statistics is the study of uncertainty. More specifically, it is the science of probability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why it studies the What: The outcomes of any and every natural process vary in random, yet understandable, ways (i.e. Natural Variation). Statistics examines and specifies these patterns of randomness. By understanding natural variation, we are able to identify occurrences of unnatural variation and seek their underlying cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How it studies the What: Like many sciences, mathematics is the formal language of statistics. However, it is not its only tool. Statistics also uses computers for both simulation and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, many people view statistics as a branch of mathematics, in many ways this is true, because its origins lie within mathematics. However, it have evolved past that and is its own independent field of inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MY FIRST POST</title>

      <description>Hello there, this is my first blog post. I don&amp;rsquo;t have much to say about this, but I invite you to stay tuned because in the coming days will come out many articles.
 Also, there will be two categories of post here:
 Researches about theory (R) Applications / Practice (A)  So, keep in mind which one of the two letters the post contains, because it is to specify at a glance its type.</description>

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, keep in mind which one of the two letters the post contains, because it is to specify at a glance its type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1_R&lt;/strong&gt; its a possible title of a post about Research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1_A&lt;/strong&gt; its a possible title of a post about Applications / Practice&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>Hi there if you want to know more about me and the blog, you are in the right place. My name is Luca, I&amp;rsquo;m a computer engineer and currently a CyberSecurity student at la Sapienza, previously i was a computer engineering student also at la Sapienza. This blog is hosted with GitHub pages and made with Hugo a framework for building websites. The main topic of the blog is statistics (as you can imagine from the title of the website), here i will post all my assigned homework, I hope you will find the research posted here useful.</description>
