<h1 id="intro">INTRO<a href="#intro" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>Bayes' Theorem, is certainly one of the most important ever discovered, the reason, is that even today we use it in many different areas. Take for example a common search on the internet:
&ldquo;movie automatic shoe laces&rdquo;
the search engine will show us results also of the movie &ldquo;Back to the Future&rdquo;.</p>
<h5 id="but-why">BUT, WHY?<a href="#but-why" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h5>
<p>I mean, the search engine doesn&rsquo;t look at the movie, right? Well yes, but actually no, in the sense, it knows because many others have previously watched it and then analyzes the previous queries to understand what others are probably looking for, all this is calculated thanks to Bayes' Theorem</p>
<h1 id="a-bit-of-math">A BIT OF MATH<a href="#a-bit-of-math" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>Bayes' Theorem is a way of finding a probability when we know certain other probabilities. The formula is:
$$ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)P(B|A)}{P(B)}$$</p>
<p>Which tells us:
how often A happens given that B happens, written P(A|B)</p>
<p>When we know:
how often B happens given that A happens, written P(B|A), and how likely A is on its own, written P(A)
and how likely B is on its own, written P(B)</p>
<h1 id="an-example">AN EXAMPLE:<a href="#an-example" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<ul>
<li>dangerous fires are rare (1%)</li>
<li>but smoke is fairly common (10%) due to barbecues</li>
<li>and 90% of dangerous fires make smoke</li>
</ul>
<p>We can then discover the probability of dangerous Fire when there is Smoke:
$$ P(Fire|Smoke) = \frac{P(Fire)P(Smoke|Fire)}{P(Smoke)} = \frac{0.01 \cdot 0.9}{0.1} = 0.09$$</p>
<p>So it is still worth checking out any smoke to be sure.</p>
<h1 id="now-back-to-search-engines">NOW, BACK TO SEARCH ENGINES.<a href="#now-back-to-search-engines" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>Search Engines take this idea and scale it up a lot (plus some other tricks).
It makes them look like they can read your mind!
It can also be used for mail filters, music recommendation services and more.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>now you can guess why it is so important, but to be explicit, we can say that it allows us to draw conclusions about the population by knowing the sample.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="bayesian-vs-frequentist">BAYESIAN VS FREQUENTIST<a href="#bayesian-vs-frequentist" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>We begin our study with a simple question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the probability that the coin in my palm is heads?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since the coin lands I already know the answer, but you still don&rsquo;t, the answer you give will tell us if you are more inclined towards Bayesian or Frequentist thinking.</p>
<h5 id="lets-see-why">LET&rsquo;S SEE WHY<a href="#lets-see-why" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h5>
<ul>
<li>Frequentist: “There’s no probability about it. I may not know the answer, but that doesn’t change the fact that if the coin is heads up, the probability is 100%, and if the coin is tails up, the probability is 0%.”</li>
<li>Bayesian: “For me, the probability is 50%! For you, it’s whatever it is for you.”</li>
</ul>
<p>We can summarize the above, with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Frequentist: The parameter is not a random variable.</li>
<li>Bayesian: The parameter is a random variable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at another example that I think is very clear:</p>
<p>Imagine this situation, I&rsquo;m at home and I misplace my phone, to find it I use the app to make it beeping and the phone starts doing it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Frequentist Reasoning: I can hear the phone beeping. I also have a mental model which helps me identify the area from which the sound is coming. Therefore, upon hearing the beep, I infer the area of my home I must search to locate the phone</li>
<li>Bayesian Reasoning: I can hear the phone beeping. Now, apart from a mental model which helps me identify the area from which the sound is coming from, I also know the locations where I have misplaced the phone in the past. So, I combine my inferences using the beeps and my prior information about the locations I have misplaced the phone in the past to identify an area I must search to locate the phone.</li>
</ul>
