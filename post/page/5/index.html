 INTRO NORMAL DISTRIBUTION LOG-NORMAL DISTRIBUTION CHI-SQUARED DISTRIBUTION RATIO BETWEEN TWO CHI-SQUARED DISTRIBUTIONS - Credits  INTRO In the application made in post 13_A, we saw numerous distributions, let&rsquo;s now see in more detail a description of each.
NORMAL DISTRIBUTION We&rsquo;ve previously discussed normal distribution and its history in a blog post. However, in short to recap, it is a continuous probability distribution that is often used as a first approximation to describe real-valued random variables that tend to concentrate around a single mean value

          INTRO We have already seen in post 12_R, the definition of Brownian motion (also called Wiener process), however as the ancient Romans also said:
 &ldquo;Repetita iuvant&rdquo;
 So, in short, we can say that the Brownian motion is a standard process (one-dimensional) and stochastic, indexed with non-negative real numbers denoted by t.
BROWNIAN MOTION AS A LIMIT FOR RANDOM WALK One of several reasons, which makes the Brownian motion so important in probability theory is that it represents, in a sense, a limit for a rescaled random walk.

 INTRO POISSON CAN BE NORMAL POISSON CAN BE UNIFORM POISSON CAN BE EXPONENTIAL CONCLUSIONS  INTRO If Poisson&rsquo;s distribution were lumped in with a Pokemon, this would probably be&hellip; Ditto. The reason why, for those unfamiliar with Games Freak&rsquo;s popular franchise is relatively simple. This pokemon is peculiar, because it can take on the appearance of all others. In a certain way this also applies to the distribution of Poisson, let&rsquo;s see why.

 Intro  Live Demo   Changelog Download source code:  Intro In this new update to the simulator, has been added a new stochastic process having to do with the Poisson distribution, but I do not dwell much in this description, because much is explained in more detail in the post 8_RA.
Live Demo here, you can see my program in action   Changelog The following features and improvements have also been introduced to the program:

 INTRO ALL VALUES ARE IMPORTANT, BUT SOME SOME VALUES ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN OTHERS UNIFORM DISTRIBUTION AN EXAMPLE PROBABILITY DENSITY - Credits  INTRO In statistics, the kth order statistic of a statistical sample is equal to its kth-smallest value. Together with rank statistics, order statistics are among the most fundamental tools in non-parametric statistics and inference.
ALL VALUES ARE IMPORTANT, BUT SOME SOME VALUES ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN OTHERS Yes, I&rsquo;m not quoting George Orwell at random, the reason is that in order statistics, there are much more important numbers than others within the dataset.

 DEFINITION OF RANKING RANKING IN STATISTICS AN EXAMPLE RANK CORRELATION KENDALL RANK CORRELATION SPEARMAN RANK CORRELATION WHERE WE CAN USE IT? - Credits  DEFINITION OF RANKING A ranking is a relationship between a set of items such that, for any two items, the first is either ‘ranked higher than’, ‘ranked lower than’ or ‘ranked equal to’ the second. In mathematics, this is known as a weak order or total preorder of objects.

9_A_1 Citing Wikipedia:
 The Glivenko-Cantelli theorem shows that the empirical distribution function of a one-dimensional random variable converges, with probability 1 uniformly in x, to the actual distribution function.

 THE RUNNING MEDIAN JAVA ALGORITHM  THE RUNNING MEDIAN As we have already seen in the previous dedicated article,the median of a set of integers is the midpoint value of the data set for which an equal number of integers are less than and greater than the value.
 If we keep each number in a sorted sequence then cost of single entry is O(n) and finding median is O(n).

 Intro Live Demo Download source code:  Intro in this program I have developed a simulator of the law of large numbers, using as random variables the sum of random variables obtained with the distribution of Bernoulli. The program offers among other things, a viewport with graphs that can be resized and moved at will. It is also possible to observe that as N and M increase, the lines converge to p, so have fun experimenting.

 WHAT IS THE LAW OF LARGE NUMBERS(LLN)? WEAK LAW OF LARGE NUMBERS: STRONG LAW OF LARGE NUMBERS: WHAT IS THE CENTRAL LIMIT THEOREM? CONVERGENCE OF THE BINOMIAL TO THE NORMAL - Credits  WHAT IS THE LAW OF LARGE NUMBERS(LLN)? In probability theory, the law of large numbers (LLN) is a theorem that describes the result of performing the same experiment a large number of times. According to the law, the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value and will tend to become closer to the expected value as more trials are performed.

 INTRO WHAT ARE MARGINAL DISTRIBUTION? WHAT ARE JOINT FREQUENCY? WHAT ARE CONDITIONAL DISTRIBUTION? BAYES THEOREM: WHAT IS STATISTICAL INDEPENDENCE?  Note - Credits    INTRO in this post we will talk about what are marginal, joint and conditional distributions. later we will discuss how to use Bayes' theorem using relative frequencies. Finally, we will explain the concept of statistical independence and why, in case of independence, the relative joint frequencies are equal to the products of the corresponding marginal frequencies.

 Rounding Errors Rounding Modes - Credits  Rounding Errors Because floating-point numbers have a limited number of digits, they cannot represent all real numbers accurately: when there are more digits than the format allows, the leftover ones are omitted – the number is rounded. There are three reasons why this can be necessary:
  Too many significant digits – The great advantage of floating point is that leading and trailing zeroes (within the range provided by the exponent) don’t need to be stored.
